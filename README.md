# Soms
Introduced by the Finnish professor Teuvo Kohonen in the 1980s is sometimes called a Kohonen map or network.
To develop this neural network I follow this tutorials:

In this example I train the model with two dataset: mnist and color. If you installed Tensorflow before, you would run two main in python:

python main.py

python mnist_soms.py
