# Soms
To develop this neural network I follow this tutorials:

In this example I train the model with two dataset, mnist and color. If you installed Tensorflow before, you would run two main in python:

python main.py

<p align="center">
  <img src="your_relative_path_here" width="350"/>
  <img src="your_relative_path_here_number_2_large_name" width="350"/>
</p>

and

python mnist_soms.py
